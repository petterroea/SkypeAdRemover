Skype ad remover
=====================

*Skype ad remover* is a utility for Skype-installations running on Windows, that configures Windows to route rad.msn.com to 127.0.0.1, causing a lack of advertisement in Skype.

You are free to use the source for anything, as long as you don't harm others.

Using this software is at own risk, i am not responsible for any damage caused by using this tool.

Building it
===========
Building it is straight forward, but you will either need to wrap it as an executable using Launch4j, or running it from the command line as an administrator for it to work.

What's next?
============
Custom skype ad server? Sounds like fun.

Fun fact
==========
Skype occupies port 80 by default on many computers. If skype uses port 80 for ads, we are making it talk to itself.
